\section{Dexterous Hand Design / Optimization}

How we will create the form to follow the function!

Some random thoughts
\begin{itemize}

  \item Good simulations of the mechanisms that are being proposed are key and are very hard.   Can we get good material models?    Can we construct good models of uncertainties so that our simulation rollouts match our experiments?

  \item Can we create a setup that allows lots of randomized tests for this purpose?    Making simulations match reality appears to be hot right now.
  
\end{itemize}
