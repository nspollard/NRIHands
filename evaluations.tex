\section{Evaluations}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Generality.   If we design for a specific task list, who is to say it is broad enough to do everything we would like to do?    We can test generality with leave one out tests.   That would be an interesting result to have no matter which way it comes out.

  \item Comparison to existing robot hands.    Is it possible for existing robot hands to accomplish all grasps and manipulations within the grasp net?   If not, what fraction can they achieve, based on kinematic structure and load capabilities alone?    We can obtain experimental comparisons of our new hands vs. the Shadow and Barrett Hands available to us at CMU.   Our hypothesis is that we will be able to exceed capability and robustness of existing hands in traversing the Grasp Net Benchmark with fewer actuated degrees of freedom and lower cost.   We anticipate that the result may look quite different from the typical dexterous hand existing today.
