@inproceedings{tenorth09dataset,
	Abstract = {We introduce the publicly available TUM Kitchen Data Set as a comprehensive collection of activity sequences recorded in a kitchen environment equipped with multiple complementary sensors. The recorded data consists of observations of naturally performed manipulation tasks as encountered in everyday activities of human life. Several instances of a table-setting task were performed by different subjects, involving the manipulation of objects and the environment. We provide the original video sequences, fullbody motion capture data recorded by a markerless motion tracker, RFID tag readings and magnetic sensor readings from objects and the environment, as well as corresponding action labels. In this paper, we both describe how the data was computed, in particular the motion tracker and the labeling, and give examples what it can be used for. We present first results of an automatic method for segmenting the observed motions into semantic classes, and describe how the data can be integrated in a knowledge-based framework for reasoning about the observations.},
	Annote = {I think this is the data set that I found somewhat unnatural, as if people were instructed to behave like robots.

Nice list of challenges:
  Variability in how the same action can be performed:  different postures, different grasps, 
  Object interactions
  actions in parallel
  Occlusions and clutter
  subtlety of motions

markerless Mocap tracks 51 DOF.

first classification results for an automatic method for segmenting observed motions into semantic classes using linear-chain conditional random fields.

Action recognition:  two directions.  
1.  Holistic:  direct map from image cues and action labels, by training discriminative classifiers.
Using KTH or Weizman data sets.  Both those sets are highly articulated, e.g. jumping jacks, single view video, which means the classification will be view-dependent.  Unnatural

2.  Model-based approaches.  Action classification in phase space, using parameters of a representative model determined before hand.  Joint angles, of articulated human models.  Data sets:
CMU motion capture database
MPI HDM05 Motion capture database.
both of those are extremely articulated, well separated, unnatural, no manipulation or interaction tasks.

Karlsruhe human motion library
motion capture specifically for human motion imitation on humanoids.

A few datasets of natural motions suitable for everyday activity recognition:
CMU Kitchen data set
Due to large number of actions and high variation between actors, this data set is extremely challenging for action recognition.

LACE Indoor activity benchmark data set.  targeted towards coarser, general description of activities
MIT House_n Data Set, even coarser, aimed at recognizing activities as a whole.

It seems they may have designed the activities or trained the subjects to make visual markerless mocap feasible?  A significant part of the paper is given to discussing their markerless mocap system.

They labelled.  Manually.  Left hand, right hand, and trunk, separately.  They were guided by a motion ontology, inspired by Cyc ontology.  W.r.t. hand motion:
  TakingSomething
  LoweringAnObject
  ReleasingGraspOfSomething
  OpeningADoor
  ClosingADoor
  OpeningADrawer,
  ClosingADrawer,
  CarryingWhileLocomoting

Humans make lots of irrelevant movements.
They added
  ReachingUpward
  TakingSomethingFromAbove
as specializations
Trunk actions:
  StandingStill
  humanWalkingProcess

To segment.  Used linear chain conditional random fields.  Trained on hand labelled data.  Evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation.  Showed a confusion matrix.  All sequences on the same subject.

Also tested cross-subject classification.  

Integration into knowledge base.  Used for planning sequences, choosing good place for an action.},

	Abstract = {Recognizing manipulations performed by a human and the transfer and execution of this by a robot is a difficult problem. We address this in the current study by introducing a novel representation of the relations between objects at decisive time points during a manipulation. Thereby, we encode the essential changes in a visual scenery in a condensed way such that a robot can recognize and learn a manipulation without prior object knowledge. To achieve this we continuously track image segments in the video and construct a dynamic graph sequence. Topological transitions of those graphs occur whenever a spatial relation between some segments has changed in a discontinuous way and these moments are stored in a transition matrix called the semantic event chain (SEC). We demonstrate that these time points are highly descriptive for distinguishing between different manipulations. Employing simple sub-string search algorithms, SECs can be compared and type-similar manipulations can be recognized with high confidence. As the approach is generic, statistical learning can be used to find the archetypal SEC of a given manipulation class. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on a set of real videos showing hands manipulating various objects and performing different actions. In experiments with a robotic arm, we show that the SEC can be learned by observing human manipulations, transferred to a new scenario, and then reproduced by the machine.},

	Abstract = { This paper represents the first part of an effort to codify the knowledge required for manipulation tasks in a small-batch manufacturing cell. The motivation for this work is to pave the way for robots that can independently determine how to grasp and manipulate parts in a limited environment and to facilitate the design of advanced, but cost-effective manufacturing hands. We begin with an examination of grasps used by humans working with tools and metal parts. The grips are compared in terms of power, contact area, friction, damping and tactile sensitivity. The comparison leads to a grip taxonomy in which grasps are mapped against task-related quantities (such as power) and object-related quantities (such as slenderness). The examinations of the task requirements and grasps suggest a number of general principles for the design and control of manufacturing hands.},
