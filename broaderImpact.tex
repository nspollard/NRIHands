Having dexterous robots will affect many areas of our lives.   Dexterous robots can render competent assistance in manual tasks to improve our quality of life, our health, and our safety.     Educational broader impact includes K-12 outreach efforts.  For example, we have recently brought the discussion of robot hands in to the elementary school classroom.    Evaluation metrics will be available as grasping and manipulation benchmarks.   Grasp Nets and robot hand designs will be made available so that others can access and build upon our results.   The PIs have an excellent track record with mentoring underrepresented students and undergraduates and will continue this trend.
